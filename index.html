                <p class="introduction">I am an incoming freshman at the City College of New York (CCNY) majoring in Computer Science with an interest in finance and data science. I am Chinese-American and the first person in my family to go to college. I am an avid-learner who has held several leadership positions in the past. I have a lot of experience working in a team whether that's working together with my peers or leading a group project. I hope to gain more valuable experiences in my life and learn more about the world.</p>
